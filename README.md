## Description

Rugby Manager is a command-line sports management simulation game where you take control of a rugby team. Manage players, plan strategies, simulate matches, and compete to lead your team to victory.  

This project demonstrates:  

- Designing a game simulation entirely in Python  
- Implementing object-oriented programming for teams, players, and matches  
- Managing complex logic and game rules in a structured way  
- Handling user input and command-line interaction  

> ⚡ Note: The codebase is large (~2,500 lines) and was written before I fully mastered maintainable practices. It demonstrates problem-solving, handling complex systems, and was an important learning experience in code organization and refactoring.
